# Bro & VAST

This package enables Bro to leverage the [`bro-to-vast`][bro-vast] tool for
querying [VAST][vast] from Bro scripts.

VAST is a platform for network forensics at scale. Integrating it into Bro
allows threat hunters to automate routine tasks, for example using historic
data to give context to new intelligence feed entries.

## Features

- Historic intelligence lookups: when new intelligence becomes available,
  go back in time and look for connections that involved the new intelligence.

- Run arbitrary queries in VAST and process results natively in Bro scripts.

## Installation

The scripts ship as a Bro package. Installation follows the standard procedure:

```shell
bro-pkg install bro-vast
```

## Usage

First, make sure that VAST and [`bro-to-vast`][bro-to-vast] are running,
otherwise the scripts will not be able to communicate with VAST.

To enable historic intelligence lookups, just load the following script:

```bro
@load bro-vast/intel.bro
```

Bro then generates a new file `historic-intel.log` with the results of historic
intelligence lookups.

To test your setup locally, you can load the [example intel file](example.intel)
as follows:

```shell
bro 'Intel::read_files += {"example.intel"}' scripts/intel.bro
```

## Configuration

See the `export` section of the scripts for a complete description of tuning
knobs.

### intel.bro

This script integrates VAST with the [intelligence framework][intel-framework]:
Whenever Bro processes a new intelligence item, the script performs a historic
lookup for the new item in VAST. If there exists relevant data, VAST sends the
result back, which the scripts then writes into the file `historic-intel.log`.

If there's currently no connection to VAST, then the script queues the item
until the connection becomes available again.

### main.bro

This script defines the basic functions to communicate with VAST. You can
configure how Bro should connect to `bro-to-vast` with the two variables
`VAST::bridge_host` and `VAST::bridge_port`. They default to `127.0.0.1` and
`43000/tcp`.
